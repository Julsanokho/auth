# auth
### User login with Kotlin with Java Spring Boot Framework and handle the JWT Token. 
### Login using JWT( JSON Web Token ) which is the standard method for SPA Authentications. 
### This application is not using the traditional "Bearer method" but instead it will login using HttpOnly cookies which is a more secure authentication.
